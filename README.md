Cognnect is a platform for Virtual Reality Therapy for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment. By using Virtual Reality to conduct cognitive training, patients can undergo cognitive training at home, as VR environments can now be run on tablets and phones, increasing accessibility and doctorsâ€™ efficiency.

In this sample, a web application is created using Flask which models two different tests: the Stroop test, which tests the patient's reaction time to selecting the colour of a mismatched word and a simple head tilt exercise, which measures the degree to which the patient can tilt their head.

## Running

Mac/Linux: `export FLASK_APP=application.py`
Windows: `set FLASK_APP=application.py`

Mac/Linux: `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://vzihzhagmfngky:e520bab65138c9d74fc92b5f48330f530dd8a3e33ecb51c9ca2781ea5fd8ddd4@ec2-174-129-226-232.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d6tj5q6d0li4u6`

Windows: `set DATABASE_URL=postgres://vzihzhagmfngky:e520bab65138c9d74fc92b5f48330f530dd8a3e33ecb51c9ca2781ea5fd8ddd4@ec2-174-129-226-232.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d6tj5q6d0li4u6`

Alternatively, you can do `source init/init.sh` in a UNIX command line (Mac/Linux) or `call init\init.bat` in Windows for set up these environment variables automatically.

To run the flask application, enter `flask run`.

The website can now be accessed at `localhost:5000` in a browser.

# Cognnect

Cognnect is a platform for Virtual Reality Therapy for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment. By using Virtual Reality to conduct cognitive training, patients can undergo cognitive training at home, as VR environments can now be run on tablets and phones, increasing accessibility and doctorsâ€™ efficiency.

In this sample, a web application is created using Flask which models two different tests: the Stroop test, which tests the patient's reaction time to selecting the colour of a mismatched word and a simple head tilt exercise, which measures the degree to which the patient can tilt their head.
